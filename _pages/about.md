About
======
I am a 4th-year undergraduate at [Zhiyuan College](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn). Currently I am advised by [Prof. Zhenli Xu](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xuzl/) at SJTU. Most recently, I was mentored by [Prof. Li-Lian Wang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/lilian/) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). I've also had the privilege of collaborating with [Prof. Hehu Xie]()

My research interests lie in neural network methods for high dimensional partial differential equations and scientific computing.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf).
